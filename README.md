Option pricing is a fundamental aspect of financial engineering. This repository provides Python implementations of several widely-used option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, Binomial Tree model, and Monte Carlo simulations.
These models can be used to price European and American options, as well as other derivatives.

Models Included:

> Black-Scholes Model: A closed-form solution for pricing European options.
> Binomial Tree Model: A discrete-time model for pricing American and European options.
> Monte Carlo Simulation: A numerical method for pricing options using random sampling.
> Finite Difference Method: A numerical approach for solving the Black-Scholes PDE.
> Implied Volatility Calculation: A method to compute the implied volatility given an option price.
> And much more!
